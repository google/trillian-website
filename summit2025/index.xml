      <title>Implementing transparency in UEFI boot managers</title>
      <link>https://transparency.dev/summit2025/talks/uefi.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://transparency.dev/summit2025/talks/uefi.html</guid>
      <description>The creation of go-boot, an UEFI boot manager written entirely in bare metal Go, eases use of modern cryptographic frameworks in very early boot stages. We will showcase our integration effort in bringing transparency frameworks to pre-boot environments and their role in defining an API abstraction for bootloader use in Secure Boot and Claimant model enforcement.

      <title>Key Transparency / When Collusion-Based Security Fails</title>
      <link>https://transparency.dev/summit2025/talks/kt-brendon.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://transparency.dev/summit2025/talks/kt-brendon.html</guid>
      <description>Almost all deployed transparency systems require finding at least one independent and trustworthy third party to help operate the system. Key Transparency systems, however, are deployed by individual organizations to protect their own users. Finding an independent and trustworthy third party in these use-cases is often an overwhelming hurdle to deployment. This talk discusses why, and how the Key Transparency protocol being standardized at IETF solves this problem.
 Speaker Brendan is a freelance cryptography engineer who focuses on developing and deploying standards that make the whole Internet safer.</description>

      <title>Reproducible Builds, a very brief summary of the last 12 years and a glimpse into the future</title>
      <link>https://transparency.dev/summit2025/talks/reproducible-builds.html</link>

      <guid>https://transparency.dev/summit2025/talks/reproducible-builds.html</guid>
      <description>In this lightning talk Holger will briefly present the achievements of the Reproducible Builds project in the last 12 years, covering both upstream developments as well as some distro specific details. The talk will conclude with an outlook into the future and an invitation to collaborate to bring transparency logs into Reproducible Builds projects.
 Speaker Holger Levsen has been a Debian user since almost 30 years and an official Debian member since 2007.</description>

      <title>silentct: A Certificate Transparency monitor that filters out the noise</title>
      <link>https://transparency.dev/summit2025/talks/silentct.html</link>

      <guid>https://transparency.dev/summit2025/talks/silentct.html</guid>
      <description>Certificate Transparency sets out to make the web&amp;rsquo;s public-key infrastructure auditable. Yet, anyone who&amp;rsquo;s tried to opt in to such auditing quickly notices they get a lot of notifications about legitimately issued certificates. For example, a site that uses Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt regularly gets their certificate renewed once every 60 days. With the upcoming short lived certificates, this could go as low as once every few days. This is a lot of certificate notifications for a single site, not to mention if one is someone managing multiple sites!</description>

      <title>Split-View protection in centralised transparency logs</title>
      <link>https://transparency.dev/summit2025/talks/split-view.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://transparency.dev/summit2025/talks/split-view.html</guid>
      <description>In this talk I will present an approach to achieve split-view protection in centralised transparency log. The technique relies on a few cryptographic building blocks (digital signatures and verifiable random function) and is provably secure against 1/3 corrupted active users, in settings where all communication goes via the transparency log. This is the case of the original design of messaging apps, and may be relevant to other centralised services. For further details, see https://eprint.</description>
