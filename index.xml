      <description>HTTPS security relies on hundreds of Certificate Authorities (CAs) whose job is to issue certificates while checking that the requester is eligible. For example, they should only issue a certificate for mozilla.org to entities that can prove they control mozilla.org (hopefully only authorized people at Mozilla!).
Unfortunately any CA can issue a certificate for any domain (more or less). So an obscure CA in Russia could issue a legitimate certificate for a UK bank.</description>

      <description>This is a short video showing how quick download Trillian from github and get it running.
Assumptions:
 You have MySQL installed, listening on the standard MySQL port 3306 (mysql --host=127.0.0.1 --port=3306 connects OK) The root MySQL user does not require a password  </description>

      <title>Add tamper checking to a package manager</title>

      <description>Advantages  Ensure all users receive exactly the same code for a given package version. Protect you against hacked Github accounts force-pushing malicious code. Minimise the impact of a hacked download server. Protect you from a man-in-the-middle attack serving a tampered package with malicious code. Prevent upstream authors modifying the source code of an existing released version.   How it works Tamper checking means the ability to detect if a package file has been modified since it was first added to the package manager.</description>

      <description>Binary Transparency Breakout Room (Part I) With the widespread success of certificate transparency, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t long before the transparency principles were applied to other domains. Several projects emerged, such as Go module checksum database, Sigstore, and Sigsum, often grouped under the broader umbrella of &amp;lsquo;Binary Transparency&amp;rsquo;. But what exactly is Binary Transparency? Can we define it in a meaningful way that fosters collaborative growth across these initiatives and delivers transformative benefits on par with those seen in the certificate transparency ecosystem?</description>

      <description>How to design a verifiable system       Is anyone monitoring the integrity of your data, or could it be tampered without anyone spotting it? Is anyone verifying the authenticity of the data in the log, or are you blindly trusting&amp;nbsp;it? Are you logging enough to actually gain a benefit? Or too much and you risk releasing something sensitive?   Design a verifiable system and get more from your log  For a system to be verifiable, you need to think more carefully about what you&#39;re logging and why.</description>

      <title>Imagining a zero-trust future for PyPI</title>
      <link>https://transparency.dev/summit2024/pypi.html</link>

      <guid>https://transparency.dev/summit2024/pypi.html</guid>
      <description>Over the past year, PyPI (the default package index for the Python ecosystem) has moved rapidly to adopt digital attestations, building atop the foundations offered by the Sigstore project and previous initiatives like Trusted Publishing. This work has left PyPI itself in a stronger position than ever before, but has not yet meaningfully diminished the amount of trust required by package consumers in PyPI. This talk attempts to tackle the latter: it imagines a hypothetical “zero-trust” future for PyPI, and asks which technologies (whether currently practical and not) could get us to that future.</description>

      <title>ML Model Signing: Cryptographically paving the way to transparency in machine learning models</title>
      <link>https://transparency.dev/summit2024/modelsigning.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://transparency.dev/summit2024/modelsigning.html</guid>
      <description>How do I know where my machine learning model came from, and how can I prove it? This question has remained largely unanswered as adoption of machine learning and artificial intelligence has skyrocketed, with over 600,000 ML models freely available on model repositories like Hugging Face. Current cryptographic signing mechanisms are not designed with ML models in mind, nor are they fit for purpose largely due to one simple fact: models are not just a singular file.</description>

      <description>Advantages  Guarantee that an audit record is created for all actions performed on your servers. Configure servers to block and report actions that weren&amp;rsquo;t already logged. Any malicious actions are permanently logged, increasing the likelihood of discovery. You can integrate additional code to monitor the log for potentially malicious actions. It simplifies incident response and forensic analysis as you&amp;rsquo;ve got a complete log you can rely on. You can prove to auditors exactly what actions were performed on each server.</description>

      <description>Key Transparency offers tamper-evident key discovery Key Transparency is a design for a tamper-evident key discovery service that providers of end-to-end encryption services could implement. Key Transparency solves the problem of key discovery using Trillian&amp;rsquo;s Map Mode.
Advantages of Key Transparency  Automate user discovery of end-to-end encryption keys. Provide a shared global view of public keys - everyone should see the same public key for a given username. Increase the difficulty of an attacker performing a man-in-the-middle attack.</description>

      <description>Background The TrustFabric team launched Trillian in 2016 as an implementation for verifiable logs - a tamper-evident data structure based on Merkle trees. Since then, Trillian has been adopted by, and had transformative impact on, applications like Certificate Transparency, binary transparency, and AI model transparency. Trillian provides readers with APIs to get entries from the log and request proofs from the log to verify it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been tampered with.

      <guid>https://transparency.dev/articles/logs-a-verifiable-transport-layer/</guid>
      <description>Transparency logs are a powerful tool for storing information and presenting it to all users in such a way that they can all verify they see the same entries. Originally deployed for Certificate Transparency over a decade ago, logs are now being used to provide tamper evidence for other ecosystems such as binary transparency and AI model transparency. When a transparency log is used correctly in a tight feedback loop it allows for timely detection and response to malfeasance, forming an important part of security response to protect users.</description>

      <description>Aether’s team is responsible for running a binary download service. Naming is hard, so their service is simply called DownloadServer. Their service has some guarantees that the binary has not been tampered with, by validating a checksum on the client before any binaries are installed. Aether has a concern that this only mitigates some errors and threat models. If their download servers provide a different binary to some users along with a valid checksum then these clients could install malicious software without detection.</description>

      <description>Verifiable data structures    Verifiable log Trillian uses a Merkle tree to implement a verifiable log. Every record inserted into a verifiable log is added as a new leaf in the Merkle tree. In the diagram aboveon the right, the four records are shown along the bottom. The squares in the diagram are cryptographic hash values. The bottom level of hashes - A, B, D and F - are calculated by hashing records 1, 2, 3 and 4.</description>

      <description>Highly sensitive code managing crypto secrets needs to run in secure environments, often very constrained in capacity. Given these constraints, I will explain how we managed to fit as much logic as possible, as close to the secrets as possible, while also addressing the roles that transparency and verifiability play in ensuring security and trust.

 Verify inclusion of the value at any position in the list Cheaply verify that another Checkpoint is consistent with it  If two Checkpoints are consistent then the lists they commit to are either the same, or one is a prefix of the other. If any of this doesn’t make sense then now would be a good time to review Verifiable Data Structures.</description>

      <title>⚡ Lightning Talk: From Issuance to Revocation: Enhancing Trust in Digital Identity Ecosystems with Transparency Logs</title>
      <link>https://transparency.dev/summit2024/digitalid.html</link>

      <guid>https://transparency.dev/summit2024/digitalid.html</guid>
      <description>In this lightning talk, we will explore the critical role of transparency logs in establishing trust and security within digital identity ecosystems. Transparency logs provide a robust mechanism for creating an auditable, tamper-proof record of credential lifecycle events, including issuance, presentations, and revocations. To implement these logs effectively, it is essential to utilize privacy-preserving cryptographic techniques, alongside scalable log structures and proof systems that can meet the requirements of large-scale digital identity solutions.</description>

      <description>Transparency approaches have extremely wide applicability throughout the technology and information landscape. Different use cases have different functional and non-functional requirements which suggest the need for a diverse – but not too diverse – transparency ecosystem to enable broad, practical adoption. This lightning talk aims to stimulate conversation and highlight opportunities for advancement of transparency technology through interoperable data structures, standards, open source code, and group cooperation.

      <title>⚡ Lightning Talk: SCT Auditing Revisited</title>
      <link>https://transparency.dev/summit2024/sct-auditing.html</link>

      <description>A Signed Certificate Timestamp (SCT) is a promise that a Certificate Transparency (CT) log will eventually incorporate a certificate into its public log. This inclusion allows users to account for issued certificates and detect misissued certificates. By default, clients do not check if the log fulfilled the promise given with the SCT, as requesting a proof of inclusion from the log leaks the browsing history to the log. If an SCT is not checked, a sophisticated attacker could serve a bogus certificate that compromises privacy.</description>

      <title>⚡ Lightning Talk: The design space between CT and KT</title>
      <link>https://transparency.dev/summit2024/ctkt.html</link>

      <description>Append-only ledgers like Certificate Transparency logs are simple, elegant and the bedrock of most modern transparency systems. Key Transparency systems are comparatively complex, but achieve much stronger privacy and transparency properties and have in recent years proven they can be successfully deployed at a global scale. This talk will consider systems that fall into the middle ground between these two approaches and ask whether they offer an interesting path forward for real world applications like the WebPKI.</description>
