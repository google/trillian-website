      <description>HTTPS security relies on hundreds of Certificate Authorities (CAs) whose job is to issue certificates while checking that the requester is eligible. For example, they should only issue a certificate for mozilla.org to entities that can prove they control mozilla.org (hopefully only authorized people at Mozilla!).
Unfortunately any CA can issue a certificate for any domain (more or less). So an obscure CA in Russia could issue a legitimate certificate for a UK bank.</description>

      <description>This is a short video showing how quick download Trillian from github and get it running.
Assumptions:
 You have MySQL installed, listening on the standard MySQL port 3306 (mysql --host=127.0.0.1 --port=3306 connects OK) The root MySQL user does not require a password  </description>

      <title>Add tamper checking to a package manager</title>
      <link>https://transparency.dev/application/add-tamper-checking-to-a-package-manager/</link>

      <guid>https://transparency.dev/application/add-tamper-checking-to-a-package-manager/</guid>
      <description>Advantages  Ensure all users receive exactly the same code for a given package version. Protect you against hacked Github accounts force-pushing malicious code. Minimise the impact of a hacked download server. Protect you from a man-in-the-middle attack serving a tampered package with malicious code. Prevent upstream authors modifying the source code of an existing released version.   How it works Tamper checking means the ability to detect if a package file has been modified since it was first added to the package manager.</description>

      <guid>https://transparency.dev/how-to-design-a-verifiable-system/</guid>
      <description>How to design a verifiable system       Is anyone monitoring the integrity of your data, or could it be tampered without anyone spotting it? Is anyone verifying the authenticity of the data in the log, or are you blindly trusting&amp;nbsp;it? Are you logging enough to actually gain a benefit? Or too much and you risk releasing something sensitive?   Design a verifiable system and get more from your log  For a system to be verifiable, you need to think more carefully about what you&#39;re logging and why.</description>

      <title>Imagining a zero-trust future for PyPI</title>

      <description>Over the past year, PyPI (the default package index for the Python ecosystem) has moved rapidly to adopt digital attestations, building atop the foundations offered by the Sigstore project and previous initiatives like Trusted Publishing. This work has left PyPI itself in a stronger position than ever before, but has not yet meaningfully diminished the amount of trust required by package consumers in PyPI. This talk attempts to tackle the latter: it imagines a hypothetical “zero-trust” future for PyPI, and asks which technologies (whether currently practical and not) could get us to that future.</description>

      <title>Nowhere to Hide: Using Transparency Logs to Secure Your Supply Chain with Sigstore</title>

      <guid>https://transparency.dev/schedule/sigstore.html</guid>
      <description>Nowhere to Hide - Using Transparency Logs to Secure Your Supply Chain with Sigstore This talk explores the motivations behind signature transparency, the role of transparency in Sigstore identities, and the ongoing improvements we&amp;rsquo;re making to enhance Sigstore&amp;rsquo;s transparency adoption.
 Speaker Hayden Blauzvern is a technical lead &amp;amp; manager on Google’s Open Source Security Team, focused on making open-source software more secure through code signing and applied transparency. Hayden is a maintainer and the community chair on the Sigstore project, and is currently focused on improving supply chain security for package registries.</description>

      <guid>https://transparency.dev/application/reliably-log-all-actions-performed-on-your-servers/</guid>
      <description>Advantages  Guarantee that an audit record is created for all actions performed on your servers. Configure servers to block and report actions that weren&amp;rsquo;t already logged. Any malicious actions are permanently logged, increasing the likelihood of discovery. You can integrate additional code to monitor the log for potentially malicious actions. It simplifies incident response and forensic analysis as you&amp;rsquo;ve got a complete log you can rely on. You can prove to auditors exactly what actions were performed on each server.</description>

      <guid>https://transparency.dev/application/strengthen-discovery-of-encryption-keys/</guid>
      <description>Key Transparency offers tamper-evident key discovery Key Transparency is a design for a tamper-evident key discovery service that providers of end-to-end encryption services could implement. Key Transparency solves the problem of key discovery using Trillian&amp;rsquo;s Map Mode.
Advantages of Key Transparency  Automate user discovery of end-to-end encryption keys. Provide a shared global view of public keys - everyone should see the same public key for a given username. Increase the difficulty of an attacker performing a man-in-the-middle attack.</description>

      <description>Background The TrustFabric team launched Trillian in 2016 as an implementation for verifiable logs - a tamper-evident data structure based on Merkle trees. Since then, Trillian has been adopted by, and had transformative impact on, applications like Certificate Transparency, binary transparency, and AI model transparency. Trillian provides readers with APIs to get entries from the log and request proofs from the log to verify it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been tampered with. To read more or brush up on verifiable logs, head over to the Verifiable Data Structures page.</description>

      <title>Transparency Logs: A Verifiable Transport Layer</title>

      <guid>https://transparency.dev/articles/logs-a-verifiable-transport-layer/</guid>
      <description>Transparency logs are a powerful tool for storing information and presenting it to all users in such a way that they can all verify they see the same entries. Originally deployed for Certificate Transparency over a decade ago, logs are now being used to provide tamper evidence for other ecosystems such as binary transparency and AI model transparency. When a transparency log is used correctly in a tight feedback loop it allows for timely detection and response to malfeasance, forming an important part of security response to protect users.</description>

      <title>Transparency: An Implementer&#39;s Story</title>

      <description>Aether’s team is responsible for running a binary download service. Naming is hard, so their service is simply called DownloadServer. Their service has some guarantees that the binary has not been tampered with, by validating a checksum on the client before any binaries are installed. Aether has a concern that this only mitigates some errors and threat models. If their download servers provide a different binary to some users along with a valid checksum then these clients could install malicious software without detection.</description>

      <description>Verifiable data structures    Verifiable log Trillian uses a Merkle tree to implement a verifiable log. Every record inserted into a verifiable log is added as a new leaf in the Merkle tree. In the diagram aboveon the right, the four records are shown along the bottom. The squares in the diagram are cryptographic hash values. The bottom level of hashes - A, B, D and F - are calculated by hashing records 1, 2, 3 and 4.</description>

      <title>Verifying Evolution of Logs vs Maps</title>

      <description>Log Evolution Verifiable Logs represent a list which is committed to by a Checkpoint. Given a Checkpoint, a client can:
 Verify inclusion of the value at any position in the list Cheaply verify that another Checkpoint is consistent with it  If two Checkpoints are consistent then the lists they commit to are either the same, or one is a prefix of the other. If any of this doesn’t make sense then now would be a good time to review Verifiable Data Structures.</description>

      <guid>https://transparency.dev/schedule/sigsum.html</guid>
      <description>Sigsum is a free and open-source software project that makes a signer&amp;rsquo;s key-usage transparent. This talk introduces the design, which can be used as a building block to transparently publish executable binaries, reproducibility statements, KT tree heads, configuration files, and much more.
 Speaker Rasmus Dahlberg is a computer scientist and software engineer based in Karlstad, Sweden. He has contributed to transparency log research and development since 2016. Examples of recent contributions include his involvement in the Sigsum project and the C2SP community specifications related to witness cosigning.</description>
