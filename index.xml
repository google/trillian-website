      <description>HTTPS security relies on hundreds of Certificate Authorities (CAs) whose job is to issue certificates while checking that the requester is eligible. For example, they should only issue a certificate for mozilla.org to entities that can prove they control mozilla.org (hopefully only authorized people at Mozilla!).
Unfortunately any CA can issue a certificate for any domain (more or less). So an obscure CA in Russia could issue a legitimate certificate for a UK bank.</description>

      <title>A decentralized integrity and transparency model for web applications</title>
      <link>https://transparency.dev/summit2025/talks/webcat.html</link>

      <guid>https://transparency.dev/summit2025/talks/webcat.html</guid>
      <description>How can we bring transparency and integrity guarantees to a decentralized web, where open-source applications are hosted by many different entities? And how can we clearly communicate these complex trust relationships to end-users? This talk explores the challenges of modeling these dynamics in such ecosystems and presents design ideas from WEBCAT, a fail-closed framework that enables verifiable integrity for web applications.
 Speaker Giulio is a researcher at Freedom of the Press Foundation.</description>

      <title>Add tamper checking to a package manager</title>
      <link>https://transparency.dev/application/add-tamper-checking-to-a-package-manager/</link>

      <description>Advantages  Ensure all users receive exactly the same code for a given package version. Protect you against hacked Github accounts force-pushing malicious code. Minimise the impact of a hacked download server. Protect you from a man-in-the-middle attack serving a tampered package with malicious code. Prevent upstream authors modifying the source code of an existing released version.   How it works Tamper checking means the ability to detect if a package file has been modified since it was first added to the package manager.</description>

      <guid>https://transparency.dev/summit2025/talks/android-ct.html</guid>
      <description>This talk provides a deep dive into Android&amp;rsquo;s Certificate Transparency (CT) initiative, a crucial defense against fraudulent TLS certificates and Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. We&amp;rsquo;ll explore the journey of implementing CT across the vast Android ecosystem.
The session will cover the straightforward process for how Android app developers can opt-in CT via the Network Security Configuration to significantly enhance their app&amp;rsquo;s security. We will highlight the technical architecture, focusing on how the CT log list is securely distributed to billions of devices.</description>

      <description>Binary Transparency Breakout Room (Part I) With the widespread success of certificate transparency, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t long before the transparency principles were applied to other domains. Several projects emerged, such as Go module checksum database, Sigstore, and Sigsum, often grouped under the broader umbrella of &amp;lsquo;Binary Transparency&amp;rsquo;. But what exactly is Binary Transparency? Can we define it in a meaningful way that fosters collaborative growth across these initiatives and delivers transformative benefits on par with those seen in the certificate transparency ecosystem?</description>

      <title>Binary Transparency via Endorsements</title>
      <link>https://transparency.dev/summit2025/talks/binary-trans.html</link>

      <guid>https://transparency.dev/summit2025/talks/binary-trans.html</guid>
      <description>Distributing binary blobs across organizational boundaries — such as between internal and open-source repositories or from a developer to the public — requires establishing trust and mitigating security risks. Binary transparency refers to the collective efforts to create this trust, ensuring that a binary has not been tampered with. This challenge is particularly relevant at Google, where binaries from open-source environments are untrusted in the corporate network, and conversely, corporate binaries are untrusted by the public.</description>

      <description>The witness network safeguards against split-view attacks by transparency logs, but detecting malicious behavior by witnesses is more difficult than with transparency logs. Today&amp;rsquo;s witness network is primarily backed by custom hardware to protect witness private keys, but scaling the network will require an approach that&amp;rsquo;s easier to deploy.
Confidential computing is a hardware backed approach to protecting virtual machines in the cloud, such that neither the cloud providers or operators can tamper with key material.</description>

      <description>In this talk I will be discussing the progress that we made since The Odyssey, Android&amp;rsquo;s First Firmware Binary Transparency [CATS2023]. In particular, I will walk through the process of expanding coverage of the type of binaries that&amp;rsquo;s running on an Android device, and the rationale behind that.
In particular, I will discuss how we expanded coverage from the granularity of an entire firmware as a whole to the APK level, particularly privileged/system APKs.</description>

      <guid>https://transparency.dev/summit2025/talks/ca.html</guid>
      <description>As a Certificate Authority, Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt needs to submit pre-certificates to CT logs to get SCTs for embedding in certificates. This adds an external dependency on our issuance process, which was historically one of the big concerns CAs have had about CT. In this talk, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss how we&amp;rsquo;ve managed that availability risk through the different submission algorithms we&amp;rsquo;ve used, and what the real world impact CT has had on our certificate issuance process.</description>

      <description>Trillan helps you Discourage misbehaviour by third parties in Certificate Transparency    HTTPS security relies on hundreds of Certificate Authorities (CAs) whose job is to issue certificates while checking that the requester is eligible. For example, they should only issue a certificate for mozilla.org to entities that can prove they control mozilla.org (hopefully only authorized people at Mozilla!).
Unfortunately any CA can issue a certificate for any domain (more or less).</description>

      <guid>https://transparency.dev/summit2025/talks/package-registries.html</guid>
      <description>Over the last couple of years, we&amp;rsquo;ve seen signed provenance adopted by package registries to provide authenticity and integrity for artifacts, with transparency logs used to record signatures for discoverability of key and identity usage. How can we further leverage transparency to protect all parties involved in the production of software, adding transparency for producers, consumers and distributors?
This talk will delve into software supply chain security for package registries, applying transparency systems to secure publication and distribution.</description>

      <description>What if you could resolve a content digest (e.g. a SHA-256) to its location anywhere on the internet, just like DNS resolves a domain name to an IP address? This talk introduces ent, a simple protocol for distributed Content-Addressable Storage (CAS) that does exactly that, preserving integrity and verifiability of the underlying data even when servers are untrusted.
A common pattern that arises in many systems (and especially in anything related to transparency) is that of mutable pointers (e.</description>

      <guid>https://transparency.dev/how-to-design-a-verifiable-system/</guid>
      <description>How to design a verifiable system       Is anyone monitoring the integrity of your data, or could it be tampered without anyone spotting it? Is anyone verifying the authenticity of the data in the log, or are you blindly trusting&amp;nbsp;it? Are you logging enough to actually gain a benefit? Or too much and you risk releasing something sensitive?   Design a verifiable system and get more from your log  For a system to be verifiable, you need to think more carefully about what you&#39;re logging and why.</description>

      <description>Gopherwatch monitors the &amp;ldquo;Go modules&amp;rdquo; transparency log (containing libraries and applications), and sends notifications by email or webhook to users with subscriptions with matching Go module patterns. For example dependencies of your own software, or all software published by your organization, or friends, etc. Gopherwatch.org is a free public service, the code is open source, and it&amp;rsquo;s easy to run your own. In this talk, we&amp;rsquo;ll briefly look at Gopherwatch functionality (which, surprisingly, includes a DNS server), look at how Go modules make it into the transparency log, and discuss future work.</description>

      <guid>https://transparency.dev/summit2025/talks/heliotorrent.html</guid>
      <description>Operating a Certificate Transparency log is bandwidth-intensive and expensive. HelioTorrent can help address this by distributing Static CT tiles over BitTorrent, allowing peers to give bandwidth back whilst consuming the log. The design supports both existing torrent clients and CT clients, and lets log operators (or third party mirrors) seed torrents without needing to run any torrent-specific infrastructure. This talk will introduce the HelioTorrent implementation, outline a draft C2SP extension spec, and discuss the technical challenges encountered during development.</description>

      <description>Chrome&amp;rsquo;s CT program requires CT logs to maintain compliance with Chrome&amp;rsquo;s CT policy, which requires logs meet certain availability requirements, as well as adhere to RFC6962 and/or static-ct-api. This lightning talk describes how the Chrome CT team monitors for compliance with this policy, including what we check for, how, and what our process is for handling issues that we detect.

      <description>Over the past year, PyPI (the default package index for the Python ecosystem) has moved rapidly to adopt digital attestations, building atop the foundations offered by the Sigstore project and previous initiatives like Trusted Publishing. This work has left PyPI itself in a stronger position than ever before, but has not yet meaningfully diminished the amount of trust required by package consumers in PyPI. This talk attempts to tackle the latter: it imagines a hypothetical “zero-trust” future for PyPI, and asks which technologies (whether currently practical and not) could get us to that future.</description>

      <guid>https://transparency.dev/summit2025/talks/kt-brendan.html</guid>
      <description>Almost all deployed transparency systems require finding at least one independent and trustworthy third party to help operate the system. Key Transparency systems, however, are deployed by individual organizations to protect their own users. Finding an independent and trustworthy third party in these use-cases is often an overwhelming hurdle to deployment. This talk discusses why, and how the Key Transparency protocol being standardized at IETF solves this problem.

      <description>End-to-end encryption security guarantees crucially rely on the assumption that the user has the correct identity public key for the person they wish to communicate with. Traditionally, E2EE communication systems have required the user to perform cumbersome manual checks to verify these keys, e.g. by physically scanning QR codes, or by verbally reading a fingerprint. In practice, these verifications are rarely performed.
Key transparency, first introduced in CONIKS, allows much of this verification to be automated.</description>

      <title>Learning from Certificate Transparency Log Failures</title>

      <guid>https://transparency.dev/summit2025/talks/log-failures.html</guid>
      <description>Certificate Transparency&amp;rsquo;s defining property is verifiability, which allows any party to check that a log is behaving properly. Verifiability is intended to catch malicious logs, but in practice innocent operational mistakes have caused logs to fail to uphold their verifiable properties. Some failures, like signing an inconsistent tree head, are irrecoverable and require the log to be retired, threatening ecosystem stability. Other failures, like returning incorrect entries, are recoverable, but cause temporary disruptions to monitoring.</description>

      <description>The web browser is the most powerful application platform in existence. As long as you have the right hardware APIs, you can run anything you want in a browser. Well, almost anything. Common wisdom is that end-to-end encrypted applications should not be run in the browser. In fact, Javascript cryptography as a whole is widely Considered Harmful. This is because the server ultimately has control: if the server gives a client malicious Javascript, the client’s end-to-end security guarantees vanish.</description>

      <guid>https://transparency.dev/summit2025/talks/mtcs.html</guid>
      <description>As highlighted in last year&amp;rsquo;s transparency.dev summit, the top quantum-safe signature algorithms require significant increases in key and signature sizes. As a result, a straightforward adaptation of TLS and CT to use these algorithms results in a massive increase in the size of the TLS handshake and the storage and bandwidth requirements for CT logs. Combined with shorter certificate lifetimes, this path would introduce several significant challenges to the CT ecosystem.</description>

      <description>How do I know where my machine learning model came from, and how can I prove it? This question has remained largely unanswered as adoption of machine learning and artificial intelligence has skyrocketed, with over 600,000 ML models freely available on model repositories like Hugging Face. Current cryptographic signing mechanisms are not designed with ML models in mind, nor are they fit for purpose largely due to one simple fact: models are not just a singular file.</description>

      <description>Advantages  Guarantee that an audit record is created for all actions performed on your servers. Configure servers to block and report actions that weren&amp;rsquo;t already logged. Any malicious actions are permanently logged, increasing the likelihood of discovery. You can integrate additional code to monitor the log for potentially malicious actions. It simplifies incident response and forensic analysis as you&amp;rsquo;ve got a complete log you can rely on. You can prove to auditors exactly what actions were performed on each server.</description>

      <description>Tessera is a Go library designed for constructing tile-based transparency logs, compatible with both cloud (AWS, GCP) and non-cloud infrastructures (MySQL, POSIX, Vanilla S3+MySQL). Its engineering prioritizes secure log operation, incorporating insights gained from extensive experience managing production-grade transparency logs. This presentation will address the challenges and complexities inherent in operating such logs, and how Tessera and TesseraCT (Certificate Transparency log built on top of Tessera) provide concrete solutions for issues such as: How to protect one’s log against spam data?</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt operates one of the largest Certificate Authorities, along with Certificate Transparency logs. This talk discusses our experiences both as a submitter to CT as well as a log operator. We are excited about the new Sunlight log implementation, and will cover why we think Sunlight will be a good fit for us and for the larger CT ecosystem.
 Speaker Slides Talk Recording   Speaker Matthew is the technical lead for the Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt SRE team, which operates our Certificate Authority and Certificate Transparency logs.</description>

      <title>silentct: A Certificate Transparency monitor that filters out the noise</title>
      <link>https://transparency.dev/summit2025/talks/silentct.html</link>

      <description>Certificate Transparency sets out to make the web&amp;rsquo;s public-key infrastructure auditable. Yet, anyone who&amp;rsquo;s tried to opt in to such auditing quickly notices they get a lot of notifications about legitimately issued certificates. For example, a site that uses Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt regularly gets their certificate renewed once every 60 days. With the upcoming short lived certificates, this could go as low as once every few days. This is a lot of certificate notifications for a single site, not to mention if one is someone managing multiple sites!</description>

      <title>Split-View protection in centralised transparency logs</title>
      <link>https://transparency.dev/summit2025/talks/split-view.html</link>

      <guid>https://transparency.dev/summit2025/talks/split-view.html</guid>
      <description>In this talk I will present an approach to achieve split-view protection in centralised transparency log. The technique relies on a few cryptographic building blocks (digital signatures and verifiable random function) and is provably secure against 1/3 corrupted active users, in settings where all communication goes via the transparency log. This is the case of the original design of messaging apps, and may be relevant to other centralised services. For further details, see https://eprint.</description>

      <description>Key Transparency offers tamper-evident key discovery Key Transparency is a design for a tamper-evident key discovery service that providers of end-to-end encryption services could implement. Key Transparency solves the problem of key discovery using Trillian&amp;rsquo;s Map Mode.
Advantages of Key Transparency  Automate user discovery of end-to-end encryption keys. Provide a shared global view of public keys - everyone should see the same public key for a given username. Increase the difficulty of an attacker performing a man-in-the-middle attack.</description>

      <description>Background The TrustFabric team launched Trillian in 2016 as an implementation for verifiable logs - a tamper-evident data structure based on Merkle trees. Since then, Trillian has been adopted by, and had transformative impact on, applications like Certificate Transparency, binary transparency, and AI model transparency. Trillian provides readers with APIs to get entries from the log and request proofs from the log to verify it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been tampered with.

      <guid>https://transparency.dev/summit2025/talks/digital-id.html</guid>
      <description>Digital ID systems are being considered and created by various governments around the world. However it is rarely being discussed on how we can create these systems to be transparent and accountable. This lightening talk will discuss the holes of these systems. Especially when it comes to verifiers and issuers of digital credentials; and how transparency logs and other lessons of accountability can possibly be applied to empower the people who are being forced to trust private companies and governments with their digital ID information.</description>

      <guid>https://transparency.dev/articles/logs-a-verifiable-transport-layer/</guid>
      <description>Transparency logs are a powerful tool for storing information and presenting it to all users in such a way that they can all verify they see the same entries. Originally deployed for Certificate Transparency over a decade ago, logs are now being used to provide tamper evidence for other ecosystems such as binary transparency and AI model transparency. When a transparency log is used correctly in a tight feedback loop it allows for timely detection and response to malfeasance, forming an important part of security response to protect users.</description>

      <description>Aether’s team is responsible for running a binary download service. Naming is hard, so their service is simply called DownloadServer. Their service has some guarantees that the binary has not been tampered with, by validating a checksum on the client before any binaries are installed. Aether has a concern that this only mitigates some errors and threat models. If their download servers provide a different binary to some users along with a valid checksum then these clients could install malicious software without detection.</description>

      <description>Hardware security modules (HSMs) and transparency technology complement each other. For example, a transparency capable HSM can help adding transparency to legacy systems, such as UEFI Secure Boot, which uses RSA signatures and is unlikely to support spicy signatures anytime soon. To do that, we need an HSM that is sufficiently open and flexible.
This talk will explain how the radically open-source Tillitis TKey and Tillitis HSM work, and report the current state of development of our transparency apps for these devices.</description>

      <description>Verifiable data structures    Verifiable log Trillian uses a Merkle tree to implement a verifiable log. Every record inserted into a verifiable log is added as a new leaf in the Merkle tree. In the diagram aboveon the right, the four records are shown along the bottom. The squares in the diagram are cryptographic hash values. The bottom level of hashes - A, B, D and F - are calculated by hashing records 1, 2, 3 and 4.</description>

      <description>Transparency logs, the bedrock of systems like Certificate Transparency and the Go SumDB, promise unparalleled verifiability. But this promise comes with a hidden cost. How can a user find their specific entries (their domain&amp;rsquo;s certificates, or their software&amp;rsquo;s releases) within a log containing billions of entries, without downloading terabytes of data or blindly trusting a centralized indexer? This trade-off between efficiency and verifiability has held back the full potential of transparency adoption and verification.</description>

      <description>Highly sensitive code managing crypto secrets needs to run in secure environments, often very constrained in capacity. Given these constraints, I will explain how we managed to fit as much logic as possible, as close to the secrets as possible, while also addressing the roles that transparency and verifiability play in ensuring security and trust.

      <description>Log Evolution Verifiable Logs represent a list which is committed to by a Checkpoint. Given a Checkpoint, a client can:
 Verify inclusion of the value at any position in the list Cheaply verify that another Checkpoint is consistent with it  If two Checkpoints are consistent then the lists they commit to are either the same, or one is a prefix of the other. If any of this doesn’t make sense then now would be a good time to review Verifiable Data Structures.</description>

      <guid>https://transparency.dev/summit2025/talks/things-bad.html</guid>
      <description>On a Saturday in June, after a third-party CT library failed to parse Chrome&amp;rsquo;s correctly-formatted log list, hundreds of Android apps suddenly stopped working, affecting millions of users, and costing potentially millions in lost revenue for impacted applications. This talk will discuss what happened, how we mitigated the issue, and the ongoing risks that this and other libraries pose to the CT ecosystem. We&amp;rsquo;ll also cover how we in Chrome are working to shake free dependencies that risk Chrome&amp;rsquo;s ability to enforce CT.</description>

      <description>Witness Discussion Room (Part I) In Wednesday’s talks, we explored the significance of witnessing and the need to realize fully transparent, end-to-end ecosystems. Now, it’s time to dive into the practicalities of making this vision a reality. Join this breakout session to discuss how we, as a community, can collaborate to bring these ideas to life in meaningful and effective ways.

      <title>⚡ Lightning Talk: From Issuance to Revocation: Enhancing Trust in Digital Identity Ecosystems with Transparency Logs</title>
      <link>https://transparency.dev/summit2024/digitalid.html</link>

      <guid>https://transparency.dev/summit2024/digitalid.html</guid>
      <description>In this lightning talk, we will explore the critical role of transparency logs in establishing trust and security within digital identity ecosystems. Transparency logs provide a robust mechanism for creating an auditable, tamper-proof record of credential lifecycle events, including issuance, presentations, and revocations. To implement these logs effectively, it is essential to utilize privacy-preserving cryptographic techniques, alongside scalable log structures and proof systems that can meet the requirements of large-scale digital identity solutions.</description>

      <description>Transparency approaches have extremely wide applicability throughout the technology and information landscape. Different use cases have different functional and non-functional requirements which suggest the need for a diverse – but not too diverse – transparency ecosystem to enable broad, practical adoption. This lightning talk aims to stimulate conversation and highlight opportunities for advancement of transparency technology through interoperable data structures, standards, open source code, and group cooperation.

      <title>⚡ Lightning Talk: SCT Auditing Revisited</title>
      <link>https://transparency.dev/summit2024/sct-auditing.html</link>

      <guid>https://transparency.dev/summit2024/sct-auditing.html</guid>
      <description>A Signed Certificate Timestamp (SCT) is a promise that a Certificate Transparency (CT) log will eventually incorporate a certificate into its public log. This inclusion allows users to account for issued certificates and detect misissued certificates. By default, clients do not check if the log fulfilled the promise given with the SCT, as requesting a proof of inclusion from the log leaks the browsing history to the log. If an SCT is not checked, a sophisticated attacker could serve a bogus certificate that compromises privacy.</description>

      <title>⚡ Lightning Talk: The design space between CT and KT</title>
      <link>https://transparency.dev/summit2024/ctkt.html</link>

      <guid>https://transparency.dev/summit2024/ctkt.html</guid>
      <description>Append-only ledgers like Certificate Transparency logs are simple, elegant and the bedrock of most modern transparency systems. Key Transparency systems are comparatively complex, but achieve much stronger privacy and transparency properties and have in recent years proven they can be successfully deployed at a global scale. This talk will consider systems that fall into the middle ground between these two approaches and ask whether they offer an interesting path forward for real world applications like the WebPKI.</description>
