# Transparency.dev Community Blog Guidelines

## Objectives

The goal of the [transparency.dev community blog](https://blog.transparency.dev/) is to advance topics and conversations that are relevant to driving transparency technology adoption and evolution in existing ecosystems and new industry domains.

## Themes and Topics

   * Certificate Transparency
   * Key Transparency
   * Binary Transparency
   * Witness Network
   * Transparency projects and project updates
   * Transparency research
   * Transparency in other domains e.g. healthcare
   * Transparency.dev ecosystem and events

## Guidelines

   * The blog aims to share timely content produced by the transparency.dev community. This includes ecosystem updates, project updates, events, best practices, lessons learned, and research.
   * Community oriented, conversational type posts are welcome.
   * The blog is not suited to long-lived reference pieces or highly technical articles or specs (these can be posted on the Articles section of transparency.dev or in Github). 
   * Posts should not promote vendor products or organizations. Vendors may be mentioned but it should not feel like an advertisement for products, services or companies. 
   * AI-generated posts are not accepted.
   * Press releases are not accepted.
   * The content must belong to the author, but can be published elsewhere with a right to republish. All content should have an author and be published Creative Commons with Attribution.
