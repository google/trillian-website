## Code of Conduct

All event participants, whether they are attending in-person or participating virtually, are expected to behave in accordance with professional standards, the following code of conduct as well as venue policies and applicable laws. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everyone.‚Äç

### TL;DR

We are committed to fostering a positive and inclusive environment for all participants. Our event is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). Constructive engagement is encouraged, where ideas are shared respectfully and with an openness to dialogue. Disruptive interruptions, personal judgments on others' work, and non-constructive, repetitive debate are not conducive to a productive atmosphere and will not be tolerated. We expect all attendees to contribute thoughtfully and help maintain a collaborative space for learning and growth. Anyone who witnesses or is subjected to unacceptable behavior should notify a conference organizer at once.

## The Full Version

Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Speakers, sponsors and attendees are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, community members or organizers should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organizers will take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from the event or community. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an organiser immediately. We value your attendance. We expect participants to follow these rules on all utilised platforms.

Unacceptable behavior in a conference setting includes actions that disrupt the productive exchange of ideas and create a hostile environment. This can manifest as repeated interruptions during presentations or discussions, excessive arguing that derails the conversation, and bad faith criticisms that are personal or not aimed at constructive dialogue. Instead, disagreements should be approached with openness and curiosity, focusing on identifying and evaluating trade offs rather than pushing a single idea. Participants should strive to create a culture where questions and proposals are welcome, challenges are expressed concretely with suggestions for improvement, and communication is concise and respectful.

There are different ways to report an incident. Please contact a conference organizer on site or email Patrick Flynn (paflynn@google.com) or Tracy Miranda (tracy@tracymiranda.com).
