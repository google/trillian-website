In this talk I will present an approach to achieve split-view protection in
centralised transparency log. The technique relies on a few cryptographic
building blocks (digital signatures and verifiable random function) and is
provably secure against 1/3 corrupted active users, in settings where all
communication goes via the transparency log. This is the case of the original
design of messaging apps, and may be relevant to other centralised services.
