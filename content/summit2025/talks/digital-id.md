Digital ID systems are being considered and created by various governments
around the world. However it is rarely being discussed on how we can create
these systems to be transparent and accountable. This lightening talk will
discuss the holes of these systems. Especially when it comes to verifiers and
issuers of digital credentials; and how transparency logs and other lessons of
accountability can possibly be applied to empower the people who are being
forced to trust private companies and governments with their digital ID
information.
