Tessera is a Go library designed for constructing tile-based transparency logs,
compatible with both cloud (AWS, GCP) and non-cloud infrastructures (MySQL,
POSIX, Vanilla S3+MySQL). Its engineering prioritizes secure log operation,
incorporating insights gained from extensive experience managing
production-grade transparency logs. This presentation will address the
challenges and complexities inherent in operating such logs, and how Tessera and
TesseraCT (Certificate Transparency log built on top of Tessera) provide
concrete solutions for issues such as: How to protect oneâ€™s log against spam
data? What information to hand over to clients, and when? And much more...
