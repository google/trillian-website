Chrome's CT program requires CT logs to maintain compliance with Chrome's CT
policy, which requires logs meet certain availability requirements, as well as
adhere to RFC6962 and/or static-ct-api. This lightning talk describes how the
Chrome CT team monitors for compliance with this policy, including what we check
for, how, and what our process is for handling issues that we detect.
