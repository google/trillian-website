Hardware security modules (HSMs) and transparency technology complement each
other. For example, a transparency capable HSM can help adding transparency to
legacy systems, such as UEFI Secure Boot, which uses RSA signatures and is
unlikely to support spicy signatures anytime soon. To do that, we need an HSM
that is sufficiently open and flexible.

This talk will explain how the radically open-source
[Tillitis](https://www.tillitis.se/) TKey and Tillitis HSM work, and report the
current state of development of our transparency apps for these devices. This
includes a general-purpose signer app that only signs a message if it is already
published in a transparency log; as well as log and witness signing apps that
can mitigate split views at the hardware level.
