It's best practice to protect sensitive signing keys using a hardware
security module (HSM). An HSM allows its users to sign messages, but
not extract private keys for later use.

HSMs and transparency technology complement each other. E.g., a
transparency capable HSM can help adding transparency to legacy
systems, such as UEFI Secure Boot, which uses RSA signatures and is
unlikely to support spicy signatures anytime soon. To do that, we need
an HSM that is sufficiently open and flexible.

This talk will explain how Tillitis TKey and Tillitis HSM work, and
report the current state of development of transparency apps for these
devices.
