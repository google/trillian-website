The witness network safeguards against split-view attacks by transparency logs,
but detecting malicious behavior by witnesses is more difficult than with
transparency logs. Today's witness network is primarily backed by custom
hardware to protect witness private keys, but scaling the network will require
an approach that's easier to deploy.

Confidential computing is a hardware backed approach to protecting virtual
machines in the cloud, such that neither the cloud providers or operators can
tamper with key material. This talk will cover how confidential computing works,
how we can leverage it to run witnesses in the cloud, and other potential
applications of confidential computing.
