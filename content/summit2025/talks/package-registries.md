Over the last couple of years, we've seen signed provenance adopted by package
registries to provide authenticity and integrity for artifacts, with
transparency logs used to record signatures for discoverability of key and
identity usage. How can we further leverage transparency to protect all parties
involved in the production of software, adding transparency for producers,
consumers and distributors?

This talk will delve into software supply chain security for package registries,
applying transparency systems to secure publication and distribution. We'll
discuss points of compromise along the software development lifecycle, such as a
compromised registry and the risk of compromised user accounts, and propose
leveraging binary transparency systems to mitigate these risks. Transparency
systems will be used to secure publication with signed artifacts and provide
verification policies that map keys and identities to their artifacts.
Registries will host binary transparency logs to record package publications to
provide a consistent view for consumers and provide a verifiable lookup for
package versions. As we scale up the number of transparency logs, so too must we
scale up monitoring, so we'll wrap up by discussing strategies for claim
verification.
