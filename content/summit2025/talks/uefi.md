The creation of go-boot, an UEFI boot manager written entirely in bare metal Go,
eases use of modern cryptographic frameworks in very early boot stages. We will
showcase our integration effort in bringing transparency frameworks to pre-boot
environments and their role in defining an API abstraction for bootloader use in
Secure Boot and Claimant model enforcement.
