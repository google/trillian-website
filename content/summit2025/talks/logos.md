This lightning talk explores how BIMI (Brand Indicators for Message
Identification) Certificate Transparency logs expose a new dataset centered not
on server identities, but on brand logos and trademarks. It will shed light on
the state of BIMI CT logs, providing insights into issuance patterns, CA
distribution, certificate types, and anomalies.

The talk will further discuss how monitoring BIMI CT logs can be used to
strengthen brand protection. This includes detecting logo misuse, brand
impersonation, phishing attempts, monitoring certificate expiry, certificate
hygiene issues, and discovery. Some examples include misleading SVG content,
lookalike logos, and mismatches between logos and certificate organization
names. This demonstrates how transparency helps defenders detect brand abuse
early and strengthen trust in email ecosystems.
