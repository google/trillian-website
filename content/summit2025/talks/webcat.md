How can we bring transparency and integrity guarantees to a decentralized web,
where open-source applications are hosted by many different entities? And how
can we clearly communicate these complex trust relationships to end-users? This
talk explores the challenges of modeling these dynamics in such ecosystems and
presents design ideas from [WEBCAT](https://github.com/freedomofpress/webcat), a
fail-closed framework that enables verifiable integrity for web applications.
