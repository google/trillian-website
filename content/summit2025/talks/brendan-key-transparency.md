<div class="font-google font-medium">

Almost all deployed transparency systems require finding at least one
independent and trustworthy third party to help operate the system. Key
Transparency systems, however, are deployed by individual organizations to
protect their own users. Finding an independent and trustworthy third party in
these use-cases is often an overwhelming hurdle to deployment. This talk
discusses why, and how the Key Transparency protocol being standardized at IETF
solves this problem.
