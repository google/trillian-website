This talk provides a deep dive into Android's Certificate Transparency (CT)
initiative, a crucial defense against fraudulent TLS certificates and
Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. We'll explore the journey of implementing CT
across the vast Android ecosystem.

The session will cover the straightforward process for how Android app
developers can opt-in CT via the Network Security Configuration to significantly
enhance their app's security. We will highlight the technical architecture,
focusing on how the CT log list is securely distributed to billions of devices.
We'll also share an honest look at the challenges and valuable lessons learned
from deploying a critical security feature at Android's scale safely.
