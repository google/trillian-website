Operating a Certificate Transparency log is bandwidth-intensive and expensive.
HelioTorrent can help address this by distributing Static CT tiles over
BitTorrent, allowing peers to give bandwidth back whilst consuming the log. The
design supports both existing torrent clients and CT clients, and lets log
operators (or third party mirrors) seed torrents without needing to run any
torrent-specific infrastructure. This talk will introduce the HelioTorrent
implementation, outline a draft C2SP extension spec, and discuss the technical
challenges encountered during development.
