On a Saturday in June, after a third-party CT library failed to parse Chrome's
correctly-formatted log list, hundreds of Android apps suddenly stopped working,
affecting millions of users, and costing potentially millions in lost revenue
for impacted applications.  This talk will discuss what happened, how we
mitigated the issue, and the ongoing risks that this and other libraries pose to
the CT ecosystem. We'll also cover how we in Chrome are working to shake free
dependencies that risk Chrome's ability to enforce CT.
