Gopherwatch monitors the "Go modules" transparency log (containing libraries and
applications), and sends notifications by email or webhook to users with
subscriptions with matching Go module patterns. For example dependencies of your
own software, or all software published by your organization, or friends, etc.
Gopherwatch.org is a free public service, the code is open source, and it's easy
to run your own. In this talk, we'll briefly look at Gopherwatch functionality
(which, surprisingly, includes a DNS server), look at how Go modules make it
into the transparency log, and discuss future work. Then we'll switch to a
higher gear and discuss (a glimpse of) two other tools delivering automated
software updates, with a transparency log of their own.
