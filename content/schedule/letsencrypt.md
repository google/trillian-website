Let's Encrypt operates one of the largest Certificate Authorities, along with Certificate Transparency logs.  This talk discusses our experiences both as a submitter to CT as well as a log operator. We are excited about the new Sunlight log implementation, and will cover why we think Sunlight will be a good fit for us and for the larger CT ecosystem.
