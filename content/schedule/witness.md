In this focused session, "From Witnessing to Transparent Ecosystems," we will explore the journey from the foundational concept of "witnessing" to the realization of fully transparent, end-to-end ecosystems. Our four talks are structured to interlock seamlessly, providing a holistic view of Witnessing and its broader impact.

   * Witnessing & ArmoredWitness overview - Martin Hutchinson
   * Using TamaGo to build the ArmoredWitness - Andrea Barisani
   * Firmware Transparency for the ArmoredWitness - Al Cutter
   * End-to-end transparency from logging to monitoring - Fillipo Valsorda

### Speakers

*Filippo Valsorda*

Filippo is a cryptography engineer and an open source maintainer. He's been maintaining the Go cryptography standard library since 2018, first as the head of the Go Security team at Google, and then as the founder of the independent maintainers organization Geomys. He co-designed the Go Checksum Database and worked on the Sigsum log design, contributing to the specification of the interoperable checkpoint format, witness API, and related C2SP specs. He's been involved in the Certificate Transparency ecosystem since its early days, operating an experimental log in 2017, and more recently authoring the Sunlight CT log implementation and the Static CT API specification. 

*Andrea Barisani*

[Andrea Barisani](https://andrea.bio/) is an internationally recognized security researcher. Since owning his first Commodore-64 he has never stopped studying new technologies, developing unconventional attack vectors and exploring what makes things tick...and break.

His experience builds on large-scale infrastructure defense, penetration testing and code auditing with particular focus on safety critical environments, with more than 15 years of professional experience in security consulting.

His main focus lies on the converge between secure hardware and software, an interest consolidated in the authorship of the USB armory hardware project and the TamaGo bare metal framework.

*Martin Hutchinson*

Martin is a software engineer at Google, primarily working in open source.
He's been developing and maintaining the TrustFabric open source portfolio since 2019, working on everything from CT, Trillian, witnessing, development of specs, and the Claimant Model.
Prior to this chapter in open source, he was an SRE and this still drives a passion to make software secure, scaleable, reliable, and maintainable.

*Al Cutter*

Al is the Tech Lead for the TrustFabric team at Google, where he's been designing and implementing open source transparency-related systems, specs, and tooling since 2012.
He was awarded the [2024 Levchin Prize](https://rwc.iacr.org/LevchinPrize/winners.html#CT) for creating and deploying Certificate Transparency at scale, and is currently working to enable the easy adoption of transparency principles and infrastructure by other ecosystems too.
