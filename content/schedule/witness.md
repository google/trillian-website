In this focused session, "From Witnessing to Transparent Ecosystems," we will explore the journey from the foundational concept of "witnessing" to the realization of fully transparent, end-to-end ecosystems. Our four talks are structured to interlock seamlessly, providing a holistic view of Witnessing and its broader impact.

   * Witnessing & ArmoredWitness overview - Martin Hutchinson
   * Using TamaGo to build the ArmoredWitness - Andrea Barisani
   * Firmware Transparency for the ArmoredWitness - Al Cutter
   * End-to-end ecosystems - Fillipo Valsorda
