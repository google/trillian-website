The final segment of the conference focuses on collaborative efforts to advance our ecosystem. The Birds-of-a-Feather session offers an informal space where everyone is welcome to share ideas, work on projects, or dive deep into code, all while fostering meaningful connections. Community leaders will be available to answer questions and engage with attendees on a variety of topics. Some of the proposed topics include:

   * Monitoring logs
   * Sigsum
