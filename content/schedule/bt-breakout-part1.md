### Binary Transparency Breakout Room (Part I)

With the widespread success of certificate transparency, it wasn't long before the transparency principles were applied to other domains. Several projects emerged, such as Go module checksum database, Sigstore, and Sigsum, often grouped under the broader umbrella of 'Binary Transparency'. But what exactly is Binary Transparency? Can we define it in a meaningful way that fosters collaborative growth across these initiatives and delivers transformative benefits on par with those seen in the certificate transparency ecosystem?

To explore this further and help shape the future of this space, we invite you to join the Binary Transparency breakout room. This is your chance to collaborate, discuss ideas, and contribute to the evolution in this critical space that helps secure our digital ecosystems.
