In this lightning talk, we will explore the critical role of transparency logs in establishing trust and security within digital identity ecosystems. Transparency logs provide a robust mechanism for creating an auditable, tamper-proof record of credential lifecycle events, including issuance, presentations, and revocations. To implement these logs effectively, it is essential to utilize privacy-preserving cryptographic techniques, alongside scalable log structures and proof systems that can meet the requirements of large-scale digital identity solutions. We will examine how transparency logs can be applied to verifiable credential management systems, fostering accountability for issuers and verifiers while instilling confidence in users.
