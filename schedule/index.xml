      <title>Imagining a zero-trust future for PyPI</title>
      <link>https://transparency.dev/schedule/pypi.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://transparency.dev/schedule/pypi.html</guid>
      <description>Over the past year, PyPI (the default package index for the Python ecosystem) has moved rapidly to adopt digital attestations, building atop the foundations offered by the Sigstore project and previous initiatives like Trusted Publishing. This work has left PyPI itself in a stronger position than ever before, but has not yet meaningfully diminished the amount of trust required by package consumers in PyPI. This talk attempts to tackle the latter: it imagines a hypothetical “zero-trust” future for PyPI, and asks which technologies (whether currently practical and not) could get us to that future.</description>

      <title>Nowhere to Hide: Using Transparency Logs to Secure Your Supply Chain with Sigstore</title>
      <link>https://transparency.dev/schedule/sigstore.html</link>

      <guid>https://transparency.dev/schedule/sigstore.html</guid>
      <description>This talk explores the motivations behind signature transparency, the role of transparency in Sigstore identities, and the ongoing improvements we&amp;rsquo;re making to enhance Sigstore&amp;rsquo;s transparency adoption.
 Speaker Hayden Blauzvern is a technical lead &amp;amp; manager on Google’s Open Source Security Team, focused on making open-source software more secure through code signing and applied transparency. Hayden is a maintainer and the community chair on the Sigstore project, and is currently focused on improving supply chain security for package registries.</description>

      <guid>https://transparency.dev/schedule/letsencrypt.html</guid>
      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt operates one of the largest Certificate Authorities, along with Certificate Transparency logs. This talk discusses our experiences both as a submitter to CT as well as a log operator. We are excited about the new Sunlight log implementation, and will cover why we think Sunlight will be a good fit for us and for the larger CT ecosystem.
 Speaker Matthew is the technical lead for the Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt SRE team, which operates our Certificate Authority and Certificate Transparency logs.</description>

      <description>Sigsum is a free and open-source software project that makes a signer&amp;rsquo;s key-usage transparent. This talk introduces the design, which can be used as a building block to transparently publish executable binaries, reproducibility statements, KT tree heads, configuration files, and much more.
 Speaker Rasmus Dahlberg is a computer scientist and software engineer based in Karlstad, Sweden. He has contributed to transparency log research and development since 2016. Examples of recent contributions include his involvement in the Sigsum project and the C2SP community specifications related to witness cosigning.</description>

      <title>⚡ Lightning Talk: SCT Auditing Revisited</title>
      <link>https://transparency.dev/schedule/sct-auditing.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://transparency.dev/schedule/sct-auditing.html</guid>
      <description>A Signed Certificate Timestamp (SCT) is a promise that a Certificate Transparency (CT) log will eventually incorporate a certificate into its public log. This inclusion allows users to account for issued certificates and detect misissued certificates. By default, clients do not check if the log fulfilled the promise given with the SCT, as requesting a proof of inclusion from the log leaks the browsing history to the log. If an SCT is not checked, a sophisticated attacker could serve a bogus certificate that compromises privacy.</description>
