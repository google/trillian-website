      <description>Binary Transparency Breakout Room (Part I) With the widespread success of certificate transparency, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t long before the transparency principles were applied to other domains. Several projects emerged, such as Go module checksum database, Sigstore, and Sigsum, often grouped under the broader umbrella of &amp;lsquo;Binary Transparency&amp;rsquo;. But what exactly is Binary Transparency? Can we define it in a meaningful way that fosters collaborative growth across these initiatives and delivers transformative benefits on par with those seen in the certificate transparency ecosystem?</description>

      <description>In this focused session, &amp;ldquo;From Witnessing to Transparent Ecosystems,&amp;rdquo; we will explore the journey from the foundational concept of &amp;ldquo;witnessing&amp;rdquo; to the realization of fully transparent, end-to-end ecosystems. Our four talks are structured to interlock seamlessly, providing a holistic view of Witnessing and its broader impact.

      <title>Imagining a zero-trust future for PyPI</title>
      <link>https://transparency.dev/summit2024/pypi.html</link>

      <guid>https://transparency.dev/summit2024/pypi.html</guid>
      <description>Over the past year, PyPI (the default package index for the Python ecosystem) has moved rapidly to adopt digital attestations, building atop the foundations offered by the Sigstore project and previous initiatives like Trusted Publishing. This work has left PyPI itself in a stronger position than ever before, but has not yet meaningfully diminished the amount of trust required by package consumers in PyPI. This talk attempts to tackle the latter: it imagines a hypothetical “zero-trust” future for PyPI, and asks which technologies (whether currently practical and not) could get us to that future.</description>

      <title>ML Model Signing: Cryptographically paving the way to transparency in machine learning models</title>
      <link>https://transparency.dev/summit2024/modelsigning.html</link>

      <guid>https://transparency.dev/summit2024/modelsigning.html</guid>
      <description>How do I know where my machine learning model came from, and how can I prove it? This question has remained largely unanswered as adoption of machine learning and artificial intelligence has skyrocketed, with over 600,000 ML models freely available on model repositories like Hugging Face. Current cryptographic signing mechanisms are not designed with ML models in mind, nor are they fit for purpose largely due to one simple fact: models are not just a singular file.</description>

      <description>Highly sensitive code managing crypto secrets needs to run in secure environments, often very constrained in capacity. Given these constraints, I will explain how we managed to fit as much logic as possible, as close to the secrets as possible, while also addressing the roles that transparency and verifiability play in ensuring security and trust.

      <description>Sigsum is a free and open-source software project that makes a signer&amp;rsquo;s key-usage transparent. This talk introduces the design, which can be used as a building block to transparently publish executable binaries, reproducibility statements, KT tree heads, configuration files, and much more.

      <description>Witness Discussion Room (Part I) In Wednesday’s talks, we explored the significance of witnessing and the need to realize fully transparent, end-to-end ecosystems. Now, it’s time to dive into the practicalities of making this vision a reality. Join this breakout session to discuss how we, as a community, can collaborate to bring these ideas to life in meaningful and effective ways.

      <title>⚡ Lightning Talk: From Issuance to Revocation: Enhancing Trust in Digital Identity Ecosystems with Transparency Logs</title>
      <link>https://transparency.dev/summit2024/digitalid.html</link>

      <guid>https://transparency.dev/summit2024/digitalid.html</guid>
      <description>In this lightning talk, we will explore the critical role of transparency logs in establishing trust and security within digital identity ecosystems. Transparency logs provide a robust mechanism for creating an auditable, tamper-proof record of credential lifecycle events, including issuance, presentations, and revocations. To implement these logs effectively, it is essential to utilize privacy-preserving cryptographic techniques, alongside scalable log structures and proof systems that can meet the requirements of large-scale digital identity solutions.</description>

      <description>Transparency approaches have extremely wide applicability throughout the technology and information landscape. Different use cases have different functional and non-functional requirements which suggest the need for a diverse – but not too diverse – transparency ecosystem to enable broad, practical adoption. This lightning talk aims to stimulate conversation and highlight opportunities for advancement of transparency technology through interoperable data structures, standards, open source code, and group cooperation.

      <title>⚡ Lightning Talk: SCT Auditing Revisited</title>
      <link>https://transparency.dev/summit2024/sct-auditing.html</link>

      <description>A Signed Certificate Timestamp (SCT) is a promise that a Certificate Transparency (CT) log will eventually incorporate a certificate into its public log. This inclusion allows users to account for issued certificates and detect misissued certificates. By default, clients do not check if the log fulfilled the promise given with the SCT, as requesting a proof of inclusion from the log leaks the browsing history to the log. If an SCT is not checked, a sophisticated attacker could serve a bogus certificate that compromises privacy.</description>

      <title>⚡ Lightning Talk: The design space between CT and KT</title>
      <link>https://transparency.dev/summit2024/ctkt.html</link>

      <description>Append-only ledgers like Certificate Transparency logs are simple, elegant and the bedrock of most modern transparency systems. Key Transparency systems are comparatively complex, but achieve much stronger privacy and transparency properties and have in recent years proven they can be successfully deployed at a global scale. This talk will consider systems that fall into the middle ground between these two approaches and ask whether they offer an interesting path forward for real world applications like the WebPKI.</description>
